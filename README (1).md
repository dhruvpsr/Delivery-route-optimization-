# Drone Delivery Route Optimization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing delivery routes for drones using geospatial data. By leveraging various data structures and algorithms, we aim to enhance the efficiency and speed of drone deliveries while minimizing costs and resource utilization.

## Features
- **Geospatial Data Handling:** Utilizes geospatial data to map delivery locations and optimize routes.
- **Data Structures:** Implements relevant data structures such as graphs, trees, and priority queues for efficient route planning.
- **Algorithms:** Employs algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search algorithm, or genetic algorithms for route optimization.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualization tools to display optimized routes and delivery paths on maps.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/dhruvpsr/delivery-route-optimization.git`
2. **Install Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Application:** `python main.py`



## Usage
1. **Input Data:** Provide input data containing delivery locations, drone capabilities, and other relevant parameters.
2. **Run Optimization:** Execute the optimization algorithm to compute the most efficient delivery routes.
3. **Visualize Results:** Utilize visualization tools to visualize optimized routes and analyze delivery paths.

## Visualization
- **Graph Visualization:** The project includes code for visualizing the graph structure used for route optimization. It plots latitude and longitude coordinates of delivery locations, along with node IDs and edges between nodes. The visualization provides insights into the spatial distribution of delivery points.
